# Mochilero API

An open-source project to display hitchs of backpackers on live.

_Mochilero_ is a collaborative project. When travelling and being carried doing hitch on the road, mark it on the web app. This way we can calculate the bests roads and places for a backapacker to hitch!

Currently under development, hosted at http://mochilero-api.herokuapp.com.

## Application overview

The API runs in node, using expressjs and [sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/) as the ORM to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
The UI code may be found [here](https://github.com/farolfo/mochilero-ui).
